You have javadocs but I feel they could be a bit more in depth, especially methods where understanding how something is calculated would be useful.  You will normally find this on some methods such as compareTo as an example.
Your NPCs have the potential to spawn outside of the map.
You have a save game section but no way to save it or load it!
When going around houses, ones with a triangle top can be walked through. Even if this intentional I would make the people be behind the house instead of in front of it (draw the house after the person)
Diagonal is still faster than normal movement but this is due to how rounding works.  You'll find in a lot of older (especially pixel are games) they just don't allow diagonal movement due to lack of precision.
Looks like you have some interactions you wanted to do but never got them finished.

Overall good job!  Just some small stuff to keep an eye on in the future if you want to make another game!  Time is always the biggest enemy.
